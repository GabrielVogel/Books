# Unsupervised Algorithm summary

## KMEANS
- Characterization of clusters using clusters means
- Dont allow complex shapes
## DBSCAN
- Complex shapes
- Detection of noise points
- Can produce clustering of different sizes

## Hierarchical Clustering
- Hierarchy of possible partitions of the data
- Visualized via dendrograms
